# Module 2 Challenge

## Description

Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio  

This project was created from scratch. The objective of this challenge is to create a portfolio of work to showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a position. This portfolio will include all of the projects created during the Bootcamp and it will be updated as new projects are created.

This portfolio was created using recently learned core skills such as flexbox, media queries and CSS variables.

## User Story

AS AN employer  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether
they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work  
WHEN I load their portfolio  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them  
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation  
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section  
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work  
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications  
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application  
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others  
WHEN I click on the images of the applications  
THEN I am taken to that deployed application  
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices  
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
